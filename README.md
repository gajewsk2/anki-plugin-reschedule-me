# anki-reschedule-me
An Anki Add-on to allow for easy scheduling changes from the browser.

I use this when I know I have seen a word outside of anki, but failed it, and want to set it to review immediately. This is especially awesome for sentence/word mining.

Make an edit at Tools -> add-ons-> RescheduleMe... to setup hotkeys.

Ctrl+R will reschedule the highlighted cards in the Card Browser to today.

Shift+R will open the Reschedule Menu to allow for more complex options.
